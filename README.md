## 📘 Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors

**File:** `task1.py`

### Description
This program reads the content of a file named `sample.txt` line by line and handles errors if the file does not exist.

### Example Output (if file exists)
```
Reading file content:
Line 1: This is a sample text file.
Line 2: It contains multiple lines.
```

### Example Output (if file does not exist)
```
Error: The file 'sample.txt' was not found.
```

## 📝 Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File

**File:** `task2.py`

### Description
This program:
1. Takes user input and writes it to a file named `output.txt`.
2. Appends additional user input to the same file.
3. Reads and displays the final content of the file.

### Example Output
```
Enter text to write to the file: Hello, Python!
Data successfully written to output.txt.

Enter additional text to append: Learning file handling in Python.
Data successfully appended.

Final content of output.txt:
Hello, Python!
Learning file handling in Python.
```
